All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.4.0] - 2019-07-31

### Added
* `BaseVersion.bump()`, which takes care of setting or resetting the right numbers. It's also exposed to child classes. Edge cases are taken into account
* Pre-rapid-release version numbers (like 1.5.0.1) are now supported. There are a few edge cases still unsupported (e.g.: 3.0.19-real-real)
* `VersionType.RELEASE_CANDIDATE` was added to support pre-rapid-release version numbers.

### Changed
* `VersionType.RELEASE` and `VersionType.ESR` have their integer bumped, so `VersionType.RELEASE_CANDIDATE` fits in.
* `PatternNotMatchedError` now takes several patterns
* `GeckoVersion` now raises when an "a2" version is created after [Project Dawn](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1353821) happened.


## [0.3.4] - 2019-07-09

### Changed
* [Bug 1561617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561617): part 3 - FennecVersion accepts 68.X because of the [version.txt of beta](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr68/file/59a3b58682a8a2de6bb29834d583d6e59bdf70f1/mobile/android/config/version-files/beta/version.txt).


## [0.3.3] - 2019-07-08

### Changed
* [Bug 1561617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561617): part 2 - FennecVersion accepts 68.Xa1.


## [0.3.2] - 2019-06-26

### Changed
* [Bug 1561617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561617): part 1 - FennecVersion doesn't accept any version >=69 and accepts 68.XbN.


## [0.3.1] - 2018-11-12

### Changed
* `BalrogVersion`, `GeckoVersion` and derivatives are now hashable.

### Added
* `mozilla_version.version.BaseVersion` to expose semver-like numbers.
* `mozilla_version.maven.MavenVersion` to handle Maven version and more precisely the ones like `0.30.0-SNAPSHOT`.


## [0.3.0] - 2018-09-20

### Changed
* `VersionType.ESR` is now greater than `VersionType.RELEASE`. This facilitates filtering on mixed-list of releases.

### Added
* `mozilla_version.gecko.GeckoSnapVersion` to handle Ubuntu Snap packages.

### Fixed
* `GeckoVersion._compare()` doesn't cast other to `FirefoxVersion` anymore.


## [0.2.2] - 2018-09-07

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2018-08-10

### Changed
* `FirefoxVersion` was moved from `mozilla_version.firefox` to `mozilla_version.gecko`
* `FirefoxVersion()` doesn't parse strings anymore. `FirefoxVersion.parse(string)` should be called instead.
* `FirefoxVersion()` allows to build version numbers by specifying raw values directly

### Added
* In `mozilla_version.gecko`: `ThunderbirdVersion`, `FennecVersion`, `DeveditionVersion`, and `GeckoVersion`. The latter being a class that has generic support of the others (+ `FirefoxVersion`)
* Known edge cases that were ever shipped to Balrog. For instance: Firefox 38.0.5b1.
